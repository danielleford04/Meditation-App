# Meditation-App
Meditation habit-building app

This app is my midterm project for RefactorU. This project is used as a way for me to showcase some of my skills. In this app I used AngularJS. It includes a meditation timer, a place to log meditation sessions, and a calendar to plan future meditation sittings.
